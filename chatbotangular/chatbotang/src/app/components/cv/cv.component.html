        <p>Your CV should make you stand out from the other candidates. But it's best to avoid doing so in a negative
            way!

            For this reason, we have compiled the ten main mistakes not to make on your resume

        <p>1. Do not put a title</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <p>
            "It is impossible to ignore a title," insists Michel Tosi, creator of a human resources consulting agency.
            "It works as a summary of your life or your professional aspiration and situates your level of
            responsibility. "

            ðŸ‘‰ Giving a title to your CV allows you to define a clear axis, and to show that your application is
            justified, and is not made at random.
        </p>






    </div>

    <div class="whenyouvisit slogan">
        <p>2. Have a generic CV</p>
    </div>


    <div class="row">
        <p>

            It is essential to adapt your CV to the position for which you are applying. Obviously, this does not mean
            completely redoing your CV, or changing the entire layout. But it is important to adjust it a little, by
            changing the title, and by highlighting certain experiences or skills that are more in line with the offer
            you are responding to. "The recruiter must perceive that your CV is only intended for him for the position
            concerned", underlines Michel Tosi.


        </p>




    </div>


    <div class="whenyouvisit slogan">
        <p>3. Mention all your experiences</p>
    </div>


    <div class="row">
        <p>

            This is the logical continuation of the previous point, but it is useless to put experiences that have nothing to do with the environment in which you work, just to fill your CV, it would be a big mistake.


        </p>




    </div>

    <div class="whenyouvisit slogan">
        <p>4. Lie</p>
    </div>


    <div class="row">
        <p>

            Your CV is made to highlight you. So everyone tends to give themselves a bit of an advantage: "Recruiters are not fooled and they consider that 75% of CVs are 'optimized'," says Michel Tosi. But be careful not to fall into the lie.


        </p>

    <div class="whenyouvisit slogan">
        <p>5. Make a long CV</p>
    </div>


    <div class="row">
        <p>
            When you are at the beginning of your career, a classic mistake is to try to compensate by spreading out your experiences. It is logical that your CV should grow with time, but when you are leaving school, for example, your CV should fit on one page. If you already have several years of career, on the other hand, do not be too succinct. "From the age of 35, a one-page CV seems too short," explains Mireille Garolla.
