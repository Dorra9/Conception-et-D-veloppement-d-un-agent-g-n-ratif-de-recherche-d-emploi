           <p>Differentiate between hard and soft skills</p>

                Skills are all the things you know how to do. But there are two categories. The first is "hard skills" or technical skills, all the know-how that corresponds to concrete tasks. The second group concerns "soft skills": behavioral qualities that reflect your interpersonal skills within the company. 

                Hard skills correspond to several types of skills: foreign languages, software, or skills specific to certain professions. Some of these skills, such as languages, can be transferred from one professional environment to another, while others, which are highly technical, cannot be used outside of a specific position.
                
                To give you some ideas, here is a non-exhaustive list of technical skill categories:
            </p>
                <li>Software : pack office</li>
                <li>Programming (Java, Python, etc)</li>
                <li>Databases</li>
                <li>Graphics</li>
                <li>Social networks</li>
                <li>Commercial canvassing</li>
                <li>Project management</li>
                <li>Translation</li>
                <li>Commercial </li>
                <li>Translation</li>
               
         <p>
            Soft skills, or behavioral skills, are just as important, and sometimes even more so. According to a June 2019 study by PÃ´le Emploi, 60% of employers consider soft skills to be more important than know-how. However, these skills are more subjective, and therefore difficult to quantify. However, they will be useful in any type of work.

                Once you have determined what skills you want to highlight on your resume, it is important to know how to do so. Listing skills without detailing them will not be very useful: it is too vague and does not really indicate to the recruiter your level in these areas. To avoid this, consider trying to quantify your skills as much as possible, especially technical ones.

ðŸ”” You can do this through exams, or any other type of certification that you have obtained. For example, this is what it is advisable to do for language levels.

If this is not possible, feel free to give specifics to describe your level. For example, if you are an expert in Photoshop, give examples of what you can do with it. If they are less tangible skills, such as management, it is even more crucial to make it concrete: you can specify "management of a team of 10 people on graphic design projects" for example.

For soft skills, which by definition are abstract, you can describe your mastery by mentioning the experiences where you had to use these skills. If you have worked a lot independently in a communications position, for example, you can mention this to highlight your ability to take initiative and organize yourself. The idea is to try to illustrate these human skills in your background.
